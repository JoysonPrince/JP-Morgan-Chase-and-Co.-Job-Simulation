# JP-Morgan-Chase-and-Co.-Job-Simulation

Here is the detailed simulation experience and task description:

Task 1: Quiz related to Excel keyboard shortcuts and statistical formulae
Data Selection: 
i) CTRL+SHIFT+Down arrow: Selects all the data in a column
ii) SHIFT+SPACE BAR: Selects all the data in a row
iii) CTRL+A: Selects all the data in a region
iv) CTRL+SPACE: Selects the entire column
Data Formatting:
i) CTRL+1: Formats cells
ii) CTRL+T: Creates a data table
iii) ALT+O+A: Auto-format the data table
iv) CTRL+SHIFT+A: Format as currency
v) CTRL+SHIFT+!: Format as decimal number by 2 points  and many more

Task 2: Conditional Formatting the Sales data
-- Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
-- Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
-- Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
-- Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
-- Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue

Task 3: VBA and Macros to automate the tasks
Created 2 macros for the following metrics:
-- A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall 5-year sales growth
-- A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall unit sales in 2021

Task 4: Dashboard
-- Created 5 KPI's for number of accounts, sales for previous year & current year, sales% growth for the current year, average sales for both current & previous years
-- Vertical Bar chart to show the top-5 accounts by their Unit Sales
-- Vertical Bar chart to show the top-5 accounts by their 5-year Compounded annual growth rate i.e CAGR
-- Funnel chart to show the worst-5 performing accounts by the revenue they generate
-- A Pie chart to determine the % contribution of different Account types
-- Horizontal Bar chart to show the top-5 performing accounts on the basis of their 5-year CAGR
-- A combo chart of bar & line charts to show the Year-on-Year sales and sales % growth

Task 5: Data storytelling via MS PowerPoint
In the realm of data science, the ability to tell a compelling story with data is as crucial as the data itself. Data storytelling is not merely about presenting raw numbers and charts; it's about weaving a narrative that communicates insights, engages stakeholders, and drives informed decision-making
Here's why data storytelling holds paramount importance:
i) Humanizing Data
ii) Enhancing Communication
iii) Engagement and Persuasion
iv) Facilitate Decision-Making
